# Minimax Strategy Evaluator
This project implements a minimax algorithm to evaluate business strategies. The algorithm identifies the strategy with the best worst-case outcome.

## Business Strategies
- The strategies are represented as a dictionary where each key is a strategy name and the value is a list of potential outcomes:
- Each outcome represents a possible result of choosing that strategy.

## Features
- Evaluation of multiple business strategies
- Minimax approach to determine the optimal strategy
- Outputs the best strategy along with its worst-case outcome

## Usage
- Clone the repository
- Run the minimaxstrategy.py file
